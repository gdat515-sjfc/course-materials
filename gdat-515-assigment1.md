## GDAT515 - Assignment One

#### Due Date: 2019/01/20 - Before Class

#### Be prepared to discuss in class

The big data revolution has ushered in, among other things, the
widespread utilization of data visualization in the media. Regardless of
the domain - sports, politics, business, … - many compelling articles
will present diagrams, charts, maps, …, as means to emphasize some
aspect of the story. The result can vary widely, from informative to
misleading.

For this assignment, find an example of a **good** and **bad** data
visualization. The source and domain can be anything other than
information visualization text, papers, or articles. The visualization
can be sourced from your employer if they permit.

Once you have identified the good and bad examples, make a markdown that
includes both pictures as well as a detailed explanation of each
picture. The first paragraph should tell the story behind the picture:  
\* a brief description of the article  
\* the context of the visualization as it relates to the story  
\* … .  
The second paragraph should critique the visualization:  
\* did the visualization help to illustrate the point the author was
attempting to make or emphasize or was the message obscured  
\* any gratuitous frills or style issue  
\* If comparisons were made, did they make sense  
\* … .

The document should be pushed to your assignment one repository and
saved in the convention discussed in the syllabus. Be prepared to
present the document and discuss your findings in class.
