## GDAT515 - Assignment One
#### Due Date: 2019/01/20 - Before Class
#### Be prepared to discuss in class

The big data revolution has ushered in, among other things, the widespread utilization of data visualization in the 
media. Regardless of the domain - sports, politics, business, ... - many compelling articles will present diagrams, 
charts, maps, ..., as means to emphasize some aspect of the story. The result can vary widely, from informative to misleading.  

For this assignment, find an example of a **good** and **bad** data visualization. The source and domain can be anything 
other than information visualization text, papers, or articles. The visualization can be sourced from your employer if they 
permit. 

Once you have identified the good and bad examples, make a markdown that includes both pictures as well as detailed 
explanation. The first paragraph should tell the story behind the picture. The second paragraph should critique the 
visualization. 

The document should be pushed to your assignment one repository and saved in the convention discussed in the syllabus.
Be prepared to show your web page and discuss your findings in class.
