“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s
mind than any other device.” — John Tukey

Welcome to GDAT 515: Data Visualization and Presentation\! As the title
would imply, this courses develops the technical and strategic skills
necessary to convey quantitative information with visualization in a
meaningful and convincing manner.

Tactical - proficiency with the tools for developing awesome data viz:
\* ggplot2 \* plotly \* leaflet (for maps)

Strategic - the successful utilization of data visualization to: -
“improve understanding of data” (Naomi Robbins) - communicate results
- explore data

#### Course Management

Course materials and discussion will take place at
<https://github.com/gdat515-sjfc>. Once everyone has their own github
account, they will be added as team members.

#### Grading

Participation: 30%  
Assignments: 40%  
Final Assignment: 30%

#### Participation

In most classes, we’ll do a live coding exercise as a group. This is an
opportunity for you to start coding solutions with the aid of the group
and the instructor. Should you an encounter an error (we all will\!),
this will be the time to discuss it.

Your code and commentary should be in an r-markdown script that will be
submitted to your github participation repository at the completion of
class. We will set these repositories up on the first day of class.

Participation will never be evaluated by **correctness.**

Should you miss a class,

### Assignments

Each student will create a new repository for each assignment with the
following naming convention:

<first initial><last name> - assignment<number>  
ex. cgalusha-assignment1

While this might seem excessive, it will help you stay organized and
facilitates the review of the developmental material necessary for the
final submission (remember “show your work”" from the paper and pencil
days?). Unless otherwise noted, the final submission of each assignment
will be a R markdown file (.rmd).

### Final Assignment

#### Communication

Communication is extremely important yet not usually prioritized in data
science. In practice, most end users will lack technical expertise and
require explanations distilled to terms representative of the domain.
This class will help develop communication skills:

*Verbal:* Most classes will being with students briefly presenting their
assignments due that day.  
*Written:* Assignments will require an explanation of methodologies and
should be written in a linear fashion.  
*Visual:* Who doesn’t love good data viz?

#### Work Data Integration

If you have access to data through your employer, you are more than
welcome to use this for class assignments. Before doing so, confirm if
this is an acceptable practice.
