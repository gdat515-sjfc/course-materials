## GDAT515 - Assignment Two

#### Due Date: 2019/01/27 - Before Class

#### Be prepared to discuss in class

For this assignment, use your newly developed ggplot2 skills to answer a
specific question using data.

**Step 1:** Pick a domain of interest. High level examples include
economics, politics, sports, climate science, etc… .  
**Step 2:** Pose a question you would like to answer related to the
domain. For example, how has the US GDP effect poverty  
rates in NYS.  
**Step 3:** Find the data sources you will need to answer your question.

You may need to iterate through these steps a few times. It may be
challenging to find both an interesting question and a dataset that has
the information that you need to answer that question.

After you have a question and a dataset, construct a visualization that
provides a answer to your question. Think of a way to make the point as
clearly as possible and use visualization techniques that effectively
present the data.

The final submission (pushed to your github assignment two repository)
should document:  
\- the question you intend to answer  
\- where you got the data and what was required to obtain it (including
code if needed)  
\- any transformations or rearrangements of the dataset that you needed
to perform; in particular, describe how you got the data into the format
needed by ggplot2.

After you have constructed the visualization, write a caption and a
paragraph describing the visualization, and how it answers the question
you posed. Think of the figure, the caption, and the text as material
you might include in a research paper.

See Chip if you’re having a problem generating a question or accessing
the right data.
